# Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)

This project implements **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** for a **2D robot world**, as part of the **Udacity Sensor Fusion / Robotics curriculum**.  
The goal is to **track a robot’s position over time while simultaneously estimating the locations of landmarks**, using only noisy motion and sensor measurements.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, SLAM is implemented for a **two-dimensional grid world**.  
The robot moves through the environment while observing landmarks and estimating both:

- Its **own pose (x, y position)**
- The **positions of landmarks** in the environment

The system combines:
- Robot motion updates
- Noisy landmark measurements
- Constraint-based estimation (Omega–Xi formulation)

SLAM enables the robot to build a map of the environment **incrementally over time**, which is a fundamental capability in **autonomous robotics and navigation**.

## Example Output

Below is an example of a **2D robot world** with:
- **Purple “×”** → detected landmarks  
- **Red “o”** → robot final estimated position  

> This example corresponds to a **50×50 grid world**, but multiple map configurations can be generated.
